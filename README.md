# English to Hindi Machine Translation using Transformer
This project fine-tunes a pre-trained Transformer model from Hugging Face for machine translation, converting English sentences into हिंदी﻿ with high accuracy. The Transformer architecture leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual relationships between words, enabling efficient and effective translation. Using the Helsinki-NLP open-source models, this implementation showcases state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing for language translation tasks.
